# CS-172_Final_Project
This is a final project developed in the spring of 2015.

The goal of this project was to develop a console version of my school's class registration system.
Specifically I wanted the users to be able to:
-Create a profile where their information would be saved
-View course lists
-Add courses
-drop courses
-change account settings

For this project our professor wanted us to focus on object oriented programming.
